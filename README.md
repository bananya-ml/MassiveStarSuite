# MassiveStarSuite

This app is a "public facing view" of my research on massive stars, cloud complexes, spectra and deep learning. 

# Features

## Identify massive stars within Gaia DR3
Using a model trained to detect massive stars using low resolution spectra, you can use this app to find out if your source is a massice star or not!
